# ML_Ensemble_Techniques

This project tackles the issue of high customer churn rates faced by a telecommunication company.

The objective was to analyze customer data and predict churn using a variety of factors, enabling the company to enhance its retention strategies.

A predictive model was developed using techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Bagging, AdaBoost, and GradientBoost, with hyperparameter tuning. The final model achieved an accuracy of over 81%.
